    <h1 class="1">So what is a "Geir"?</h1>
    &nbsp;
<h2>Geir is the name of an iPod 4th generation the youtuber DankPods found in his first video.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>DankPods was repairing an iPod and when he went to look for a drive to put in it he found Geir. The name of the drive was Geir and was in Norwegian.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>Geir became an icon of the DankPods youtube channel and a meme later when the DankPods channel blew up. Everyone was saying Geir in any place that was related to iPods.
    Especially in the /r/iPod guild which DankPods started linking in his description.
</h4>
<h5>Soon enough the meme died and became awful, hated and disgusting. Then the /r/iPod DankPods plague started.</h5>
<h6>New kids who are joining via the DankPods link are beating on the already dead meme by spamming it whenever they can. These got the name of DankPods gremlins. Currently the Geir joke is still going on in the dankpods-discussion channel along with newer jokes like "Craig", "Cashies" or the quote "Someones been in here".</h6>
<h7>Acording to 2/1-2021 We haven't heard anything about Geir in a long time by DankPods. The name "Geir" is a norwegian name.</h7>
